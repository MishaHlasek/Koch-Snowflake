# Koch-Snowflake
Final Project Code in Place 2021

I attended Code in Place 2021 which is an intro-to-coding course built off the first half of one of most popular courses at Stanford University (CS106A).
Koch Snowflake is my final project for Code in Place 2021. 

Koch Snowflake is a fractal - that is an image which can be built up iteratively. Koch snowflake starts as an equilateral triangle. Then in each step every segment is divided into three parts where the middle part is replaced by two sides of a smaller equilateral triangle. And this process repeats over and over again.

This is Koch snowflake which my program draws if the user asks for 1000 by 1000 pixels and 5 iterations.
